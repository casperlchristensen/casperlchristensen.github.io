excerpt: "Introduces the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT) that attends across both clinical-variable and time axes in EHRs. BAT achieves SOTA on sepsis prediction, is competitive for mortality classification, and shows robustness to missingness; baselines were re-implemented in PyTorch for reproducibility."
