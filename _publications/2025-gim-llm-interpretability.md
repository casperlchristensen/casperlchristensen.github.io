excerpt: "A novel form of self-repair in the softmax operation leads to flaws in pertubation and gradient based attribution methods. GIM (gradient interaction modification) is a new method that alleviates many existing issues with gradient-based attribution methods and achieves state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks."
